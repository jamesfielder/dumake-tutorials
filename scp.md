Using scp for moving files
===============================================

scp is a unix utility which allows you to move files onto and off a device running a ssh server. This is the software we will use to move files to and from the RPi.

On windows
----------

+ Open winscp from the start menu
+ Put the ip we have given you in the host name section
+ Username: pi
+ Password: Raspberry

This should look like this

You should now be given a screen with local files in one column and files on the Pi in the other.
